# Java-Work
All of my work during university.
This is some of my history with java. I had some issues with it whenever I worked on it but whenever I did I put 110% in my code. Some of my issues were because of time constrants, or because I was stressed by other classes. I have not had time to go back to fix any of this. This is my RAW code, Over what I have learned in college and from internships I will love to learn and grow as a coder.

Thank you for taking time out to look over this and assess my code.

Thank you,

Jesse Patrick
